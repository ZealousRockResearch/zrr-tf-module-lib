# Advanced MySQL Firewall Rules Example

This example demonstrates advanced enterprise-grade usage of the MySQL Firewall Rule module with comprehensive security features, monitoring, and governance capabilities.

## What This Example Creates

- **Multiple Access Patterns**: Office networks, developer workstations, application subnets
- **Custom Firewall Rules**: Data center networks, partner access, backup services
- **Enterprise Security Features**: Monitoring, alerting, justification requirements
- **Compliance Features**: Comprehensive tagging, audit trails, governance controls
- **Azure Services Integration**: Secure access for Azure platform services

## Features Demonstrated

### Security Features
- IP range validation and enforcement
- Rule count limits and management
- Environment-specific validation
- Comprehensive access logging

### Governance Features
- Compliance tagging for SOX, PCI-DSS
- Justification requirements for production
- Change alerting and monitoring
- Quarterly review cycles

### Network Access Patterns
- **Office Networks**: Multi-location office access with CIDR support
- **Developer Access**: Individual workstation access for authorized personnel
- **Application Tiers**: Subnet-based access for application architectures
- **Data Centers**: On-premises and partner network access
- **Azure Services**: Platform service integration

## Usage

1. **Review Configuration**: Examine the `terraform.tfvars.example` file for all available options

2. **Customize for Your Environment**:
   ```bash
   cp terraform.tfvars.example terraform.tfvars
   # Edit terraform.tfvars with your specific values
   ```

3. **Key Customizations**:
   - Update MySQL server name and resource group
   - Replace example IP ranges with your actual networks
   - Adjust compliance tags for your requirements
   - Configure monitoring and alerting settings

4. **Deploy**:
   ```bash
   terraform init
   terraform plan -var-file="terraform.tfvars"
   terraform apply -var-file="terraform.tfvars"
   ```

## Security Considerations

### IP Address Management
- Use the most restrictive IP ranges possible
- Regularly audit and review access rules
- Document the purpose of each IP range
- Implement time-based access where appropriate

### Compliance Requirements
- **SOX Compliance**: Audit trails, change controls, quarterly reviews
- **PCI-DSS**: Network segmentation, access controls, monitoring
- **Data Classification**: Appropriate security controls based on data sensitivity

### Monitoring and Alerting
- Enable monitoring for all production environments
- Configure alerts for firewall rule changes
- Implement automated compliance checking
- Regular security reviews and audits

## Enterprise Integration

### With Azure Monitor
```hcl
# Enable comprehensive monitoring
enable_monitoring = true
alert_on_rule_changes = true
```

### With Azure Policy
- Enforce compliance tags on all firewall rules
- Validate IP ranges against approved networks
- Ensure justification is provided for all rules

### With DevOps Pipelines
- Automate firewall rule validation
- Implement approval workflows for changes
- Deploy via infrastructure-as-code pipelines

## Example Output

After deployment, you'll have:
- 8+ firewall rules (4 custom + 4 office networks + developer access + Azure services)
- Comprehensive monitoring and alerting
- Full compliance tagging and governance
- Detailed access summaries and reporting

## Cleanup

To remove all firewall rules:
```bash
terraform destroy -var-file="terraform.tfvars"
```

**Warning**: This will remove ALL firewall rules created by this module. Ensure this won't disrupt critical database access before proceeding.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **IP Range Validation Errors**: Ensure all IP addresses are valid IPv4 addresses
2. **Rule Count Limits**: Reduce the number of rules if approaching Azure limits
3. **Access Denied**: Verify your IP is included in the allowed ranges

### Validation Commands
```bash
# Validate IP ranges
terraform plan -var-file="terraform.tfvars"

# Check rule count
terraform output firewall_rules_count

# Review security configuration
terraform output security_configuration
```
